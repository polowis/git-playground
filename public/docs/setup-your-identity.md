First thing to do is setup your identity. This identifies you to other people who download the project.

```sh
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

> ðŸ’¡ Replace "Your Actual Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your real details.
You only need to do this once per computer (unless you change your identity or use different Git accounts).
