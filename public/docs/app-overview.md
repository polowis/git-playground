### 🧭 App Overview
Here's a quick tour of the app interface you'll be using during this workshop. Each part of the screen is here to help you learn and keep track of your progress.

--- 

### ◀️ Left Panel — Terminal
This is where you'll run all your Git and UNIX commands — like `git init`, `ls`, `touch`, and more.
Think of it as your control center: everything you type here is how you interact with Git and your project.

---

### ▶️ Right Panel — Information & Visual Feedback
There are three tabs here:

---

### 🗂️ Folder Tree

Shows your project files and folders — just like a file explorer.
Watch it update as you create, edit, or delete files.

### 🌳 Git Tree Visualization

This gives you a visual map of your Git history.
You’ll see commits appear here, branches grow, and your project evolve step-by-step.

### 📘 Learn Panel: Where We Are Now

This tab helps you stay on track.
It shows what step you're currently on, what just happened, and what to do next.

### ✅ When You’re Ready to Move On

Once you've finished a step — like running a command or making a commit — just click the "Complete" button.
This will unlock the next part of the workshop and guide you forward.

> Tip: You can switch between the tabs anytime to see what’s changed or to review where you are.

Now click on the “Complete” button to move to the next step.
