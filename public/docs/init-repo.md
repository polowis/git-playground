Next, set up Git in your project folder. This tells Git to start tracking changes in that folder.

```sh
$ git init
```

> ðŸ§  This creates a hidden `.git` folder in your project.
Itâ€™s where Git stores everything it needs to track changes â€” like a time machine for your code.
You only need to run this once per project.
