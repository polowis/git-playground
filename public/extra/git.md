# üîç What is Git?

**Git** is a version control system. It helps you track changes in your code over time, collaborate with others, and manage multiple versions of a project.

Instead of keeping one big final version of your code, Git saves a **history of changes**, so you can:

- Go back to previous versions
- See who changed what and when
- Work on features without breaking the main code
- Merge everyone's work together

# ‚öôÔ∏è How Git Works (At a High Level)

Git stores your project as a series of **snapshots** (called commits). Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **You make changes** to your code.
2. **You stage the changes** (using `git add`) ‚Äî telling Git what to track.
3. **You commit the changes** (using `git commit`) ‚Äî saving a snapshot to the history.
4. **You can push** your commits to a remote repository (e.g. GitHub) to share with others.
5. **You can pull** others‚Äô changes to stay in sync.

# üß† Key Concepts

- **Repository (repo):** A Git project folder with all your code and history.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
- **Branch:** A separate line of development (like working on a new feature).
- **Merge:** Combining changes from different branches.
- **Remote:** A copy of your project hosted online (e.g. GitHub).
- **Clone:** A local copy of a remote repository.

Git helps you move fast **without fear of breaking things.** It gives you the power to explore, collaborate, and recover when needed.
